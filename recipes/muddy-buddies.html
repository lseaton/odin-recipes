		<h1>Muddy Buddies</h1>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>
			The perfect blend of chocolate and peanut butter, muddy buddies never
			fails to satisfy. It can get messy, so watch out! This recipe will prepare
			a single serving.
		</p>
		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>3 cups chocolate Chex</li>
			<li>1/3 cup chocolate chips</li>
			<li>1/6 cup peanut butter (a big spoonful)</li>
			<li>
				1 1/3 tbsp stick butter (if it's a stick of butter, this will be a
				little less than a cm wide chonk)
			</li>
			<li>1/3 tsp vanilla extract</li>
			<li>1/2 cup powdered sugar</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Steps</h3>
		<ol>
			<li>Melt butter in the microwave, in a medium-sized bowl.</li>
			<li>
				While waiting for the butter to be ready, add the Chex to another bowl,
				and set it aside for later.
			</li>
			<li>
				When the butter is (mostly) melted, stir in chocolate chips, peanut
				butter, and vanilla.
			</li>
			<li>Microwave the bowl for 90 seconds.</li>
			<li>
				While waiting, pour the bowl of dry Chex into a gallon-sized ziploc bag.
			</li>
			<li>
				When ready, pour the chocolate mixture into the ziploc bag and zip it
				shut. Scrunch the bag until the chocolate mixture covers all the Chex.
			</li>
			<li>
				For best results, wait at least thirty minutes for the chocolate mixture
				to cool. If you are impatient, skip this step.
			</li>
			<li>
				Open the bag and pour in the powdered sugar. Zip it closed, leaving air
				inside the bag, and shake the bag until they're all covered in powdered
				sugar.
			</li>
			<li>
				Pour them back into the bowl you had the Chex in in the beginning, and
				enjoy.
			</li>
		</ol>
